The given code is a Java implementation of the combination sum problem using backtracking. It finds all unique combinations of elements from the given array `candidates` that sum up to the given target value.
​
Let's go through the code step by step and explain how it works:
​
1. The function `combinationSum2` takes in an array of integers (`candidates`) and a target value (`target`) as parameters. It initializes an empty list called `list` to store the resulting combinations.
​
2. The `candidates` array is sorted in ascending order using the `Arrays.sort` method. Sorting the array helps in skipping duplicate combinations later on.
​
3. The `backtrack` function is a recursive helper function that finds the combinations using backtracking. It takes the following parameters:
- `list`: The list to store the resulting combinations.
- `tempList`: A temporary list that stores the current combination being built.
- `cand`: The sorted array of candidates.
- `remain`: The remaining target value to be achieved.
- `start`: The index to start exploring the candidates from.
​
4. Inside the `backtrack` function, there are three main conditions:
​
a) If `remain` is less than 0, it means the current combination exceeds the target sum. In this case, we backtrack and return from the current recursion level as it is not a valid solution.
​
b) If `remain` is equal to 0, it means the current combination sums up to the target value. We add the `tempList` to the `list` as a valid combination.
​
c) If neither of the above conditions is satisfied, we proceed with the backtracking process. We iterate over the candidates starting from the `start` index.
​
5. Inside the loop, we check for duplicates and skip them to avoid generating duplicate combinations. If the current index `i` is greater than `start` (indicating it's not the first occurrence of a number) and the current candidate (`cand[i]`) is equal to the previous candidate (`cand[i-1]`), we skip this iteration.
​
6. We add the current candidate (`cand[i]`) to the `tempList` to build the combination.
​
7. The `backtrack` function is called recursively with the updated `remain` value, which is reduced by the current candidate. The `start` index is also incremented to avoid reusing the same candidate.
​
8. After the recursive call, we remove the last element from the `tempList` to backtrack and explore other possibilities.
​
Now, let's dry run the code with the given input: `candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5]` and `target = 8`.
​
Initially, the `list` is empty. The `candidates` array is sorted to `[1,1,2,5,6,7,10]`.
​
1. First call: `backtrack(list, [], [1,1,2,5,6,7,10], 8, 0)`.
​
- The remain is not less than 0.
- The remain is not equal to 0.
- Loop iteration 1:
- `i = 0`, `start = 0`. The candidate is 1. Since it is the first occurrence of 1, we add it to `tempList` and make the recursive call.
- Recursive call 1: `backtrack(list, [1], [1,2,5,6,7,10], 7, 1)`
- Recursive call 1:
