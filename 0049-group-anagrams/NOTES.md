**Approach:**
​
we will sort the each string in array and put it in map and check if it contians in the map, if doest we will   add it to map, and group similar strings  as list , go through dry run for better understanding
​
**Dry running the code**
​
Certainly! Let's dry run the provided program with the given `strs` array: `["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`.
​
1. Initialize an empty `HashMap` called `map` to store the groups of anagrams.
​
2. Iterate over each string in the `strs` array:
- First string: "eat"
- Convert it into a character array: ['e', 'a', 't']
- Sort the character array: ['a', 'e', 't']
- Convert the sorted representation back to a string: "aet"
- Check if `map` contains the key "aet". Since it doesn't, create a new entry with key "aet" and an empty `ArrayList` as the value.
- Add the current string "eat" to the list associated with the key "aet".
​
- Second string: "tea"
- Convert it into a character array: ['t', 'e', 'a']
- Sort the character array: ['a', 'e', 't']
- Convert the sorted representation back to a string: "aet"
- Check if `map` contains the key "aet". It already exists, so retrieve the existing list associated with the key.
- Add the current string "tea" to the list of anagrams: ["eat", "tea"].
​
- Third string: "tan"
- Convert it into a character array: ['t', 'a', 'n']
- Sort the character array: ['a', 'n', 't']
- Convert the sorted representation back to a string: "ant"
- Check if `map` contains the key "ant". Since it doesn't, create a new entry with key "ant" and an empty `ArrayList` as the value.
- Add the current string "tan" to the list associated with the key "ant".
​
- Fourth string: "ate"
- Convert it into a character array: ['a', 't', 'e']
- Sort the character array: ['a', 'e', 't']
- Convert the sorted representation back to a string: "aet"
- Check if `map` contains the key "aet". It already exists, so retrieve the existing list associated with the key.
- Add the current string "ate" to the list of anagrams: ["eat", "tea", "ate"].
​
- Fifth string: "nat"
- Convert it into a character array: ['n', 'a', 't']
- Sort the character array: ['a', 'n', 't']
- Convert the sorted representation back to a string: "ant"
- Check if `map` contains the key "ant". It already exists, so retrieve the existing list associated with the key.
- Add the current string "nat" to the list of anagrams: ["tan", "nat"].
​
- Sixth string: "bat"
- Convert it into a character array: ['b', 'a', 't']
- Sort the character array: ['a', 'b', 't']
- Convert the sorted representation back to a string: "abt"
- Check if `map` contains the key "abt". Since it doesn't, create a new entry with key "abt" and an empty `ArrayList` as the value.
- Add the current string "bat" to the list associated with the key "abt".
​
3. After processing all the strings, the `map` contains the following key-value pairs:
- Key: "aet"  | Value:
​
["eat", "tea", "ate"]
- Key: "ant"  | Value: ["tan", "nat"]
- Key: "abt"  | Value: ["bat"]
​
4. Create a new `ArrayList` called `result` containing all the values (lists of anagrams) from the `map`:
- `result` is now [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]].
​
5. Return the `result` list as the final output.
​
The resulting list of lists `result` represents the groups of anagrams in the original `strs` array. Each inner list contains strings that are anagrams of each other. In this case, we have [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]].
​
map.values() retrieves the collection of values (lists of anagrams) from the map, and new ArrayList<>(map.values()) creates a new ArrayList object containing those values. Returning this new ArrayList allows for flexibility and ensures that any modifications made to the original map do not affect the returned list.
